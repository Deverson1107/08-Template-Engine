Software engineering team generator command line application.

HOW IT WORKS:
This is an application run through Node.js. When loaded, the user is prompted to enter employee information that will be generated onto
an HTML document. They can enter information for three classes of employees: managers, engineers, and interns. The user can enter as
many employees as they wish. Once the user submits information on a new employee, they can either enter additional ones or complete the application. Once this completion is chosen, the rest of the HTML will generate and the user can now access an HTML file with employee cards with relevant information for each entered employee.
